<p>-Henry David Thoreau</p>

<p>Recently I was rereading <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html">Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</a> by Abelson and Sussman and was hooked by the section on streams. Streams allow one to reason about stateful phenomena while mitigating "some of the complexities of modeling state".  </p>

<p>A stream is a data structure representing the history of values for a system across time. Imagine physics' <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_line">world line</a> concept applied to any system or phenomena. If one thinks about the life of an apple over time it ages. But if one considers the entire history of the apple through time that function is constant with respect to time. I decided it would be fun to implement this concept in JavaScript.</p>

<h4 id="implementation">Implementation</h4>

<p>To easily model a stream implement it as a delayed list. This means the <strong>head</strong> of the list will be the current value and the <strong>tail</strong> will be a <strong>promise</strong> to evaluate the next element in the stream. In SICP the authors use the delay method to convert a tail into a promise and then use the force method to evaluate the promise.</p>

<pre><code>function Stream(head, tail) {  
    this.headValue = head;
    this.tailValue = this.delay(tail);
}

Stream.prototype = {  
  delay: function(tail) {
    return tail();
  },
  force: function(delayedTail){
    return delayedTail();
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="application">Application</h4>

<p>Because streams are sequences we can still use sequence methods like enumerating, filtering, accumulating, and mapping but because streams delay evaluation we can perform these manipulations on sequences that are large or infinite in size. </p>

<p>For example I can take a stream representing all integers beginning with the number 2 and run it through the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate a stream of the prime numbers.</p>

<pre><code>Stream.integersStartingFrom = function(num) {  
  return new Stream(num, function(){
    return integersStartingFrom(num += 1);
  });
};
Stream.prototype.sieve = function() {  
    var self = this;
    return new Stream(self.head(), function() {
      return self.tail().filter(function(num) {
        return !willDivide(self.head(), num);
        }).sieve();
    });
  }

var primes = Stream.integersStartingFrom(2).sieve();  
console.log(primes.item(50)); // 233  
</code></pre>

<p>Streams allow the developer to cleanly separate and intuitively reason about these types of tasks across data collections.</p>

<h4 id="improvements">Improvements</h4>

<p>One early improvement to make in a streams library is to memoize the delay method that generates the promise. Rather than reevaluating the tail everytime use a closure to store whether the tail has been evaluated in the past and if so return that result.</p>

<pre><code>Stream.prototype = {

 delay: function(tail) {
    return this._memoTail(tail);
  },

  _memoTail: function(tail){
    var hasRun = false;
    var result;
    return function(){
      if(!hasRun) {
        result = tail();
        hasRun = true;
        return result;
      } else {
        return result;
      }
    };
  }
}
</code></pre>

<h4 id="practicalusecases">Practical use cases</h4>

<p>Infinite streams of data can be found in many fields from physics, finance, and engineering. In physics as mentioned the world line is the concept of reasoning about an elements' entire history through spacetime. In finance there are many financial assets that exhibit stream like behavior such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetuity">perpetuities</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_data">stock market data</a>. In engineering they can be found in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series">fourier series</a> which has application in electrical engineering, optics, acoustics, and more.</p>

<h4 id="nextsteps">Next steps</h4>

<p>I would like to explore using the stream data structure to model some of the practical applications listed above namely the modeling of financial streams and fourier series.</p>

<h4 id="thecode">The code</h4>

<p>The full code used can be found on my github in the <a href="https://github.com/hwhelchel/streams">streams</a> repository. I would also like to mention the <a href="https://github.com/dionyziz/stream.js">streams.js</a> library by dionyziz which helped jump start my implementation of streams in JavaScript.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Recursion in Ruby]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Studying Ruby and object oriented programming at Dev Bootcamp we have been working with exercises that lend themselves to recursive thinking.

<h2 id="whatisrecursion">What is Recursion?</h2>

<p>Recursion is a method of solving problems by dividing them into the same problem of a smaller size. A recursive method calls itself a certain number of times. It is commonly found in functional languages however imperative languages such as Ruby can make use of recursive algorithms.</p>

<p>Perhaps surprisingly all iterations can be written recursively. Loops that rely on while or until are often intuitive candidates. The while or until loop condition can often be coerced into a recursive base case.</p>

<h4 id="thebasecase">The Base Case</h4>

<p>The key to recursion is limiting the number of method self-calls. To limit the number of calls we must establish a base case. When the base case has been reached the method stops calling itself and begins returning up the chain of method calls.</p>

<h2 id="considerationsforrecursioninruby">Considerations for Recursion in Ruby</h2>

<p>Recursion in Ruby and most imperative languages is considered inefficient. Because almost everything is an object in Ruby, repeated object instantiation can arise in recursive calls, leading to reduced speed. Furthermore additional stack frames are required for each method call's arguments and local variables. Too many recursive calls can lead to stack overflow induced crashes. Tail Call Recursion and Memoization can help reduce the risk of stack overflow. </p>

<h4 id="tailcalloptimization">Tail Call Optimization</h4>

<p>Tail Call Optimization allows recursive method calls without the allocation of additional memory on the stack. Simply put the calling method returns the value it gets from the called method. Therefore recursive methods are implemented in constant stack space eliminating the risk of stack overflow.</p>

<h4 id="memoization">Memoization</h4>

<p>Memoization of a method eliminates repeat calculations of results for prior inputs. A memoized method has a lookup table of prior inputs and outputs that it can use to speed up future calls for new inputs. With the added lookup table, memoization lowers a method's time cost at the expense of added space cost. If methods are well-defined, i.e. they consistently return the same output for given arguments, then this can be an effective tool to reduce the risk of stack overflow.</p>

<h2 id="bogglerecursionexample">Boggle: Recursion Example</h2>

<p>Below is a program the generates a random boggle board. It then takes a string from the user and returns true if the string is made of sequentially adjacent dice, whether they are horizontally, diagonally, or vertically neighboring. Using recursion, BoggleBoard#include? takes the first letter of the user's string and then traverses all possible paths from the occurrences of the letter on the board looking for a match.</p>
